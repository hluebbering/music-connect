## Steps to Create Web App

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: This will store your project's code.
2. **Install Necessary Tools**: Python, Flask (a lightweight WSGI web application framework), and requests (HTTP) library.

### Step 2: Register Application with Spotify
1. Log into [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Create an app to obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
3. Set the Redirect URI to point to your local or production environment (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/callback` for development).




### Step 3: Flask Backend Setup
1. **Initialize Your Flask App**: Create a basic Flask app to handle authentication and data retrieval.
   1. Create a new Python File (`app.py`)
   2. Set Up Basic Flask App

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, redirect, request, session, jsonify
   import os

   app = Flask(__name__)
   app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)  # Generates a random key for the session

   @app.route('/')
   def home():
    return 'Welcome to the Spotify Flask App!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

   ```

2. **Implement Spotify Authentication**:

   1. **OAuth 2.0 Flow**:Redirect user to Spotify’s authorization URL, where they log in. Afterward, Spotify redirects them back to specified redirect URI with an authorization code.
   2. **Set Up Environment Variables:** Store sensitive info such as Spotify Client ID and Secret securely. Use environment variables or a .env file (handled by python-dotenv package).
   3. **Implement Login and Callback Routes:**



Spotify uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. The process involves redirecting the user to Spotify’s authorization URL, where they log in. Afterward, Spotify redirects them back to your specified redirect URI with an authorization code.
You exchange this code for an access token that allows you to make requests to Spotify's API on behalf of the user.








#### Step 4: Fetching Data from Spotify
1. Use the access token to make requests to Spotify’s Web API.
2. Fetch the user's top tracks and artists by making GET requests to endpoints like `/v1/me/top/tracks`.

#### Step 5: Frontend Development
1. **Create HTML/CSS/JavaScript Files**: Build a simple user interface that displays the data fetched from the backend.
2. **JavaScript Fetch API**: Use JavaScript to connect to your Flask backend, retrieve data, and update the frontend dynamically.

#### Step 6: Deployment
1. **Deploy the Backend**:
   - Deploy your Flask application to a platform like Heroku. This involves setting up a `Procfile`, ensuring environment variables are configured (for storing your client secret and ID securely), and pushing your code to Heroku.
2. **Deploy the Frontend**:
   - Since GitHub Pages supports static sites, you’ll deploy your HTML/CSS/JavaScript files there.
   - Ensure that your frontend code makes calls to the correct backend URL (your Heroku app URL).

#### Step 7: Documentation and Publishing
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push all your code to your GitHub repository, excluding sensitive credentials which should be managed through environment variables or config files.

This setup creates a full-fledged project utilizing Spotify's data, and it’s great for your GitHub portfolio as it showcases your skills with APIs, Python, Flask, and basic frontend development. If you need any specific code snippets or further clarification on any step, just let me know!
