## Steps to Create Web App

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: This will store your project's code.
2. **Install Necessary Tools**: Includes Python, Flask (a lightweight WSGI web application framework), and requests library for making HTTP requests.

#### Step 2: Register Application with Spotify
1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.
2. Create an app to obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
3. Set the Redirect URI to point to your local or production environment (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/callback` for development).

#### Step 3: Flask Backend Setup
1. **Initialize Your Flask App**: Create a basic Flask app to handle authentication and data retrieval.
2. **Implement Authentication**:
   - Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to authenticate users with Spotify.
   - Redirect users to the Spotify authorization page and handle the callback to exchange the code for an access token.

#### Step 4: Fetching Data from Spotify
1. Use the access token to make requests to Spotify’s Web API.
2. Fetch the user's top tracks and artists by making GET requests to endpoints like `/v1/me/top/tracks`.

#### Step 5: Frontend Development
1. **Create HTML/CSS/JavaScript Files**: Build a simple user interface that displays the data fetched from the backend.
2. **JavaScript Fetch API**: Use JavaScript to connect to your Flask backend, retrieve data, and update the frontend dynamically.

#### Step 6: Deployment
1. **Deploy the Backend**:
   - Deploy your Flask application to a platform like Heroku. This involves setting up a `Procfile`, ensuring environment variables are configured (for storing your client secret and ID securely), and pushing your code to Heroku.
2. **Deploy the Frontend**:
   - Since GitHub Pages supports static sites, you’ll deploy your HTML/CSS/JavaScript files there.
   - Ensure that your frontend code makes calls to the correct backend URL (your Heroku app URL).

#### Step 7: Documentation and Publishing
1. **Document Your Project**:
   - Write a clear `README.md` that explains what the app does, how to set it up, and how to run it.
2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push all your code to your GitHub repository, excluding sensitive credentials which should be managed through environment variables or config files.

This setup creates a full-fledged project utilizing Spotify's data, and it’s great for your GitHub portfolio as it showcases your skills with APIs, Python, Flask, and basic frontend development. If you need any specific code snippets or further clarification on any step, just let me know!
